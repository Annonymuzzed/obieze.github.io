         <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
         <div class="post-content">
           <p>If somebody had told me a year ago that i would be able to make a website, i probably wouldn't have believed them. But sometime along last year i started having this growing interest and desire to know the ways of the web developer and maybe one day, be able to call myself one eventually.</p
             <p>Ever since then, i've basically lost interest in everything else and have strived to get on the path to actually becoming a web developer! This has led me on a journey to finding out about a lot of different and wonderful resources to help me reach my goal. It's been an experience, some really nice, some not so great.</p>
