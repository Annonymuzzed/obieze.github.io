           <p>Hi there! i'm <em>obieze</em> and i'm an aspiring web developer.i picked up interest in web developement sometime between late 2017 and early 2018 and since then it's been my ultimate passion and the subject of so many day dreams. I was in uni studying accounting at the point, and i was at a time where i was on the very verge of losing all possible interest in my course of study at the time which happened to be accounting. after merely stalking some developers and their works for a period of time, i decided to actually do something about this new very intruiging, possibly life altering bug in my mind.I took the first step by sigining up for <strong>ALC 3.O</strong> which is the andela led development program for aspiring developers. And once i had gotten started, i got so interested that i wanted to know anything and everything about we development, i signed up for every course, attempted every lesson, i was swept up in the aspiring developer syndrome!</p>
             <p>Ever since then, i've basically lost interest in everything else and have strived to get on the path to actually becoming a web developer! This has led me on a journey to finding out about a lot of different and wonderful resources to help me reach my goal. It's been an experience, some really nice, some not so great.
